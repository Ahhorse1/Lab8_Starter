# Lab 8 - Starter

1) Automated tests should go within a GitHub action since you want them to be run automatically when new code is pushed to the repository
2) No, End to End testing is mainly for test cases that involve Users Input
3) No, since message feature requires interaction between two users and unit testing is for individual components and not how they interact
4) Yes, since this tests the message component individually and specifically limiting the length of a message. It doesn't require an interaction with another part of the application
